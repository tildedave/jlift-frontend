This is a frontend to JLift.  The general workflow is that
I would run code through this frontend and then work with 
the code generated by this.

This is a fairly lightweight project.  We would do things like
variable renaming ('label' is a keyword in Jif and so JLift 
would bail on code with that as a variable name).  There's some
policy stuff in here but I believe that ended up mostly 
unconsumed.
